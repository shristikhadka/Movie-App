Edit
I see you have a React Native Expo movie app! Looking at your code, I can help you with various aspects of this project. Your app appears to be a movie browsing application with:

A tab-based navigation with Home, Search, Saved, and Profile screens
Integration with The Movie Database (TMDB) API
A custom search bar component
TypeScript interfaces for movie data
NativeWind for styling (Tailwind CSS for React Native)
The app structure looks well-organized, but I notice a few areas where I could help:

Movie Display Component: The home screen fetches movies but doesn't display them yet
Search Functionality: The search screen is just a placeholder
Movie Details Page: Currently empty
API Issues: There's a typo in the API configuration
Would you like me to help you with any specific feature? For example, I could:

Create a movie list component to display the fetched movies
Implement the search functionality
Build out the movie details page
Fix the API configuration issue
Add movie saving/favoriting functionality
What would you like to work on first?

Why does mine look different from the tutorial help me

Edit
I can see the issue! Your app is showing an error loading screen instead of displaying the movies like in the tutorial. Looking at your code, there are a couple of problems with the API configuration that are preventing the movies from loading.

Let me help you fix this:


Fixed API Configuration
Code 
The main issues I found were:

Header typo: You had accept: "application.json" but it should be accept: "application/json"
Wrong environment variable: You were using process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_MOVIE_API in the Authorization header, but it should be process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_MOVIE_API_KEY
Now, let's also create a MovieCard component to display the movies once they load:


MovieCard Component
Code 
Now let's update your home screen to display the movies in a grid:


Updated Home Screen
Code 
Here's what you need to do to fix your app:

Steps to Fix:
Replace your services/api.ts file with the fixed version I provided
Create a new file components/MovieCard.tsx with the MovieCard component
Replace your app/(tabs)/index.tsx file with the updated home screen
Key Fixes:
Fixed API header typo: Changed "application.json" to "application/json"
Fixed Authorization header: Now correctly uses EXPO_PUBLIC_MOVIE_API_KEY
Added better error handling: More detailed error messages
Created MovieCard component: Displays movies in a nice grid layout
Improved error display: Shows user-friendly error messages
Additional Tips:
Make sure your .env file is in the root directory
Restart your Expo development server after making these changes
If you're still having issues, you can test the API directly by adding this to your home screen temporarily:
javascript
// Add this import at the top
import { testAPI } from '@/services/api';

// Add this inside your component
useEffect(() => {
  testAPI().then(console.log).catch(console.error);
}, []);
After implementing these changes, your app should display a grid of movie posters instead of the error screen!

Edit
I see you received a security alert about your API key being exposed on GitHub! This is a serious security issue that needs immediate attention.

Immediate Actions Required:
1. Remove the API Key from GitHub (URGENT)
You need to immediately remove the exposed API key from your repository:

bash
# Remove the file from git history
git filter-branch --force --index-filter 'git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch .env' --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all

# Or use git-filter-repo (recommended)
git filter-repo --path .env --invert-paths

# Force push to remove from GitHub
git push origin --force --all
2. Generate a New API Key
Go to TMDB Settings
Delete the exposed API key
Generate a new one
3. Fix Your .gitignore
Make sure your .gitignore file includes .env:


Updated .gitignore
Code 
4. Create a Secure .env File
Create a new .env file with your new API key:


.env Template
Code 
5. Create an Environment Example File
Instead of committing your actual .env, create a .env.example:


.env.example
Code 
6. Complete Cleanup Steps
bash
# Remove any cached versions
git rm --cached .env
git rm --cached .env.local

# Add the files to your repo
git add .gitignore
git add .env.example

# Commit the changes
git commit -m "Remove exposed API key and update gitignore"

# Push the changes
git push origin main
7. Update Your README
Add instructions for other developers:


Updated README.md
Code 
Summary of Actions:
✅ Click "Fix This Secret Leak" in the GitHub notification
🔄 Generate a new TMDB API key
📝 Update your .env file with the new key
🚫 Ensure .env is in .gitignore
📋 Create .env.example for other developers
🔒 Remove the old key from git history
📚 Update your README with setup instructions
This security breach could have allowed anyone to use your API key, potentially exceeding rate limits or accessing your TMDB account. Following these steps will secure your application properly.

After fixing this, your app should work correctly with the new API key!

         set FILTER_BRANCH_SQUELCH_WARNING=1.

Edit
I see the issue! You have unstaged changes and your .gitignore doesn't include .env (only .env*.local). Let's fix this step by step:

Step 1: First, let's stage and commit your current changes
bash
# Check what files are unstaged
git status

# Stage all changes
git add .

# Commit them
git commit -m "Save current changes before cleanup"
Step 2: Update your .gitignore to include .env
Your current .gitignore only has .env*.local but not .env. Let's fix it:


Corrected .gitignore
Code 
Step 3: Remove .env from tracking and clean up
bash
# Remove .env from git tracking (if it's still tracked)
git rm --cached .env

# Update .gitignore with the corrected version above
# Then commit the changes
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "Update gitignore to exclude .env files"
Step 4: Clean up the repository history
Since you had unstaged changes, let's try a different approach:

bash
# Option 1: Use git filter-repo (recommended)
# First install it: pip install git-filter-repo
git filter-repo --path .env --invert-paths

# Option 2: If you don't have git-filter-repo, use git filter-branch
# Set the warning variable first
set FILTER_BRANCH_SQUELCH_WARNING=1
git filter-branch --force --index-filter "git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch .env" --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all
Step 5: Force push to clean GitHub
bash
# Push the cleaned history
git push origin --force --all
git push origin --force --tags
Step 6: Get a new API key and update your .env
Go to TMDB API Settings
Delete the old API key
Generate a new one
Update your .env file:
env
EXPO_PUBLIC_MOVIE_API_KEY=your_new_api_key_here
If the above doesn't work, here's a simpler alternative:
If you're still having issues, here's a nuclear option that will definitely work:

bash
# 1. Create a backup of your current code
# Copy your project folder to a backup location

# 2. Delete the repository from GitHub
# Go to your repo settings and delete it

# 3. Create a new repository
# Create a fresh repo on GitHub

# 4. Start fresh
cd your_project_folder
rm -rf .git
git init
git add .gitignore
git add . (but make sure .env is NOT included)
git commit -m "Initial commit - fresh start"
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-new-repo.git
git push -u origin main
Verify everything is clean:
bash
# Check that .env is not in the repo
git ls-files | grep .env

# This should return nothing if .env is properly ignored
Let me know which approach you'd like to take or if you run into any issues with these steps!

         filter-branch manual page for more details; to squelch this warning,
         set FILTER_BRANCH_SQUELCH_WARNING=1.

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a") 
PS C:\Users\Khadka\Desktop\mobile_movie_app>

Edit
Yes, you need to handle your unstaged changes first! The git filter-branch command can't proceed when you have unstaged changes.

Here's what you need to do:

Step 1: Handle the unstaged changes
bash
# First, let's see what changed in api.ts
git diff services/api.ts

# Then add and commit the changes
git add services/api.ts
git commit -m "Update API configuration"
Step 2: Now you can run the filter-branch command
bash
# Set the warning variable to suppress the warning
set FILTER_BRANCH_SQUELCH_WARNING=1

# Now run the filter-branch to remove .env from history
git filter-branch --force --index-filter "git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch .env" --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all
Step 3: Force push to GitHub
bash
git push origin --force --all
Complete sequence of commands:
bash
# 1. Commit your current changes
git add services/api.ts
git commit -m "Update API configuration"

# 2. Set the environment variable to suppress warnings
set FILTER_BRANCH_SQUELCH_WARNING=1

# 3. Remove .env from git history
git filter-branch --force --index-filter "git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch .env" --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all

# 4. Force push to remove from GitHub
git push origin --force --all

# 5. Verify .env is not tracked anymore
git ls-files | findstr .env
The last command should return nothing if .env has been successfully removed from tracking.

After this is done, you'll need to:

Get a new API key from TMDB
Update your local .env file with the new key
Make sure your .gitignore includes .env (which you should update as shown in my previous message)
Let me know how it goes!

Edit
I see the issue! You still have unstaged changes in services/api.ts. Let's commit those changes first, then clean up the repository.

Step 1: Commit your changes
bash
# Add and commit the API configuration changes
git add services/api.ts
git commit -m "Fix API configuration headers and authorization"
Step 2: Now clean the repository history
Since you're on Windows, let's use the correct syntax:

bash
# For Windows Command Prompt/PowerShell, set the environment variable
$env:FILTER_BRANCH_SQUELCH_WARNING=1

# Now run the filter-branch command
git filter-branch --force --index-filter "git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch .env" --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all
Step 3: Force push to GitHub
bash
git push origin --force --all
Alternative: If you keep having issues with filter-branch
Since git filter-branch can be tricky, here's an easier approach using the GitHub web interface:

Method 1: Use GitHub's Secret Scanning Fix
Click the "Fix This Secret Leak" button in the email/notification
Follow GitHub's automated process
Method 2: Simple manual cleanup
bash
# 1. Commit your current changes
git add services/api.ts
git commit -m "Fix API configuration"

# 2. Remove .env from current tracking (if it exists)
git rm --cached .env 2>$null

# 3. Update your .gitignore to include .env
# (Make sure .env is listed in .gitignore)

# 4. Commit the gitignore update
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "Add .env to gitignore"

# 5. Push the changes
git push origin main
Step 4: Secure your app
Get a new API key from TMDB API Settings
Delete the old exposed key
Create a new .env file with just:
EXPO_PUBLIC_MOVIE_API_KEY=your_new_api_key_here
Complete the API fix
Looking at your git diff, you're missing part of the environment variable name. Here's the corrected services/api.ts:


Complete API Configuration Fix
Code 
Try this sequence:

bash
# 1. First commit your changes
git add services/api.ts
git commit -m "Fix API configuration"

# 2. Try the simpler approach
$env:FILTER_BRANCH_SQUELCH_WARNING=1
git filter-branch --force --index-filter "git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch .env" --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all

# 3. Force push
git push origin --force --all
If this still doesn't work, let me know and we can try the nuclear option (recreating the repository).

Edit
Perfect! 🎉 The git cleanup was successful! I can see that:

✅ Your changes were committed
✅ The filter-branch command ran successfully and removed .env from the git history
✅ The force push updated GitHub with the cleaned history
Now let's complete the security fix:

Step 1: Verify .env is removed from tracking
bash
# Check if .env is still being tracked
git ls-files | findstr .env
This should return nothing (empty result) if .env has been successfully removed.

Step 2: Update your .gitignore
Make sure your .gitignore includes .env:


Final .gitignore
Code 
Step 3: Get a new API key
Go to TMDB API Settings
Delete the old exposed API key
Generate a new API key
Step 4: Update your local .env file
Create/update your .env file with the new API key:

env
EXPO_PUBLIC_MOVIE_API_KEY=your_new_api_key_here
Step 5: Test your app
Now restart your Expo development server:

bash
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C if running)
# Then restart
npx expo start
Step 6: Final commit of the updated .gitignore
bash
# If you updated .gitignore
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "Update gitignore to prevent future env file leaks"
git push origin main
Verification checklist:
 ✅ Old API key removed from GitHub history
 ✅ New API key generated in TMDB
 ✅ .env file updated with new key locally
 ✅ .gitignore includes .env
 ✅ App is working with new API key
Your security issue should now be resolved! The exposed API key has been removed from your GitHub repository's history, and you have a fresh, secure setup.

Let me know if your app is now working correctly with the new API key!
